## Initial Setup (Things to Note)

- The project uses expo and not react-native-cli, so make sure you have expo installed globally on your machine
- Instead of pnpm or yarn, the project runs on bun as the default package manager. 
- There are not env variables in the project, so you can run the project without any setup
- This project was tested on an iOS simulator running iOS 17.4 on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, no other devices have been tested yet
- The project uses expo router for navigation


## Improvements to be made 

- Switch from using png icons to using svgs with react-native-svg
- Break down more elements into components
